    #5610: use \Z not $ so we don't eat extra chars when body part ends with \r\n.

    If a body part ended with \r\n, feedparser, using '$' to terminate its
    search for the newline, would match on the \r\n, and think that it needed
    to strip two characters in order to account for the line end before the
    boundary.  That made it chop one too many characters off the end of
    the body part.  Using \Z makes the match correct.

    Patch and test by Tony Nelson.

catching unexpected exceptions.

Also remove exception message rewriting in _run_module_as_main(), because it

the subsequent resizing operation.

The solution was to make sure the initial string was at least two

[<b>ed5d75912d60</b>]: Skip Montanaro's contribution (slightly mod'd by Barry) to provide a
"help-on-symbol-at-point" feature which uses pydoc to provide help on
the symbol under point, if available.

Mods include some name changes, a port to Emacs, binding the command
to C-c C-h, and providing a more informative error message if the
symbol's help can't be found (through use of a nasty bare except).

Since Python 3.3, the C signal handler writes the signal number into the wakeup
file descriptor and then schedules the Python call using Py_AddPendingCall().

asyncio uses the wakeup file descriptor to wake up the event loop, and relies
on Py_AddPendingCall() to schedule the final callback with call_soon().

If the C signal handler is called in a thread different than the thread of the
event loop, the loop is awaken but Py_AddPendingCall() was not called yet. In
this case, the event loop has nothing to do and go to sleep again.
Py_AddPendingCall() is called while the event loop is sleeping again and so the
final callback is not scheduled immediatly.

This patch changes how asyncio handles signals. Instead of relying on
Py_AddPendingCall() and the wakeup file descriptor, asyncio now only relies on
the wakeup file descriptor. asyncio reads signal numbers from the wakeup file
descriptor to call its signal handler.

  Issue #9036: Throughout the code base, Py_CHARMASK is used on 8-bit wide
  signed/unsigned chars or on integers directly derived from those. In all
  cases, it could be replaced by a simple cast to (unsigned char). Reasons
  for the change:

    a) Make the comment more explicit.

    b) If char is unsigned, the cast is optimized away.

    c) If char is unsigned, gcc emits spurious "array subscript
       has type 'char'" warnings.

<pre>[<b>3b3c7b8ade7f</b>]: CRITICAL PATCH!

We occasionally received reports from people getting "invalid tstate"
crashes (this is a fatal error in PyThreadState_Delete()).  Finally
several people were able to reproduce it reliably and Tim Peters
discovered that there is a race condition when multiple threads are
calling this function without holding the global interpreter lock (the

Solved the race condition by adding a lock around the mutating uses of

it likely that this fixes the crashes -- although Tim hasn't heard
from the person who reported the original problem.
[<b>3b3c7b8ade7f</b>]: CRITICAL PATCH!

We occasionally received reports from people getting "invalid tstate"
crashes (this is a fatal error in PyThreadState_Delete()).  Finally
several people were able to reproduce it reliably and Tim Peters
discovered that there is a race condition when multiple threads are
calling this function without holding the global interpreter lock (the
function may be called without holding that).

Solved the race condition by adding a lock around the mutating uses of
interp->tstate_head.  Tim and Jonathan Giddy have run tests that make
it likely that this fixes the crashes -- although Tim hasn't heard

  #9907: call rl_initialize early when using editline on OSX

  editline rl_initialize apparently discards any mappings done before it
  is called, which makes tab revert to file completion instead of inserting
  a tab.  So now on OSX we call rl_initialize first if we are using
  readline, and then re-read the users .editrc (if any) afterward so they
  can still override our defaults.

Replace os.popen() with subprocess.Popen. Based on patch by Victor Stinner.

If the "gcc", "cc" or "objdump" command is not available, the code was
supposed to raise an OSError exception. But there was a bug in the code. The
shell code returns the exit code 10 if the required command is missing, and the
code tries to check for the status 10. The problem is that os.popen() doesn't
return the exit code directly, but a status which should be processed by
os.WIFEXITED() and os.WEXITSTATUS(). In practice, the exception was never
raised. The OSError exception was not documented and ctypes.util.find_library()
is expected to return None if the library is not found.

When WITH_PYMALLOC is defined, define PYMALLOC_DEBUG to enable the debug
allocator.  This can be done independent of build type (release or debug).
A debug build automatically defines PYMALLOC_DEBUG when pymalloc is
enabled.  It's a detected error to define PYMALLOC_DEBUG when pymalloc
isn't enabled.

Two debugging entry points defined only under PYMALLOC_DEBUG:

+ _PyMalloc_DebugCheckAddress(const void *p) can be used (e.g., from gdb)
  to sanity-check a memory block obtained from pymalloc.  It sprays
  info to stderr (see next) and dies via Py_FatalError if the block is
  detectably damaged.

+ _PyMalloc_DebugDumpAddress(const void *p) can be used to spray info
  about a debug memory block to stderr.

A tiny start at implementing "API family" checks isn't good for
anything yet.

_PyMalloc_DebugRealloc() has been optimized to do little when the new
size is <= old size.  However, if the new size is larger, it really
can't call the underlying realloc() routine without either violating its
contract, or knowing something non-trivial about how the underlying
realloc() works.  A memcpy is always done in this case.

This was a disaster for (and only) one of the std tests:  test_bufio
creates single text file lines up to a million characters long.  On
Windows, fileobject.c's get_line() uses the horridly funky
getline_via_fgets(), which keeps growing and growing a string object
hoping to find a newline.  It grew the string object 1000 bytes each
time, so for a million-character string it took approximately forever
(I gave up after a few minutes).

So, also:

fileobject.c, getline_via_fgets():  When a single line is outrageously
long, grow the string object at a mildly exponential rate, instead of
just 1000 bytes at a time.

That's enough so that a debug-build test_bufio finishes in about 5 seconds
on my Win98SE box.  I'm curious to try this on Win2K, because it has very
different memory behavior than Win9X, and test_bufio always took a factor
of 10 longer to complete on Win2K.  It *could* be that the endless
reallocs were simply killing it on Win2K even in the release build.

Fix window.addch() of the curses module for special characters like
curses.ACS_HLINE: the Python function addch(int) and addch(bytes) is now
calling the C function waddch()/mvwaddch() (as it was done in Python 3.2),
instead of wadd_wch()/mvwadd_wch(). The Python function addch(str) is still
calling the C function wadd_wch()/mvwadd_wch() if the Python curses is linked
to libncursesw.

encodestring(), decodestring(): New functions which accept a string

StringIOs and pass them to the encode() and decode() methods
respectively.  encodestring() accepts a default argument of quotetabs,
defaulting to zero, which is passed on straight through to encode().

encode(): Fix the bug where an extra newline would always be added to
the output, which prevented an idempotent roundtrip through
encode->decode.  Now, if the source string doesn't end in a newline,
then the result string won't end in a newline.

Also, extend the quotetabs argument semantics to include quoting
embedded strings, which is also optional according to the RFC.

symtable.h: Add st_nested_scopes slot.  Define flags to track exec and

compile.c: Fiddle with error messages.

    Reverse the sense of ste_optimized flag on
    PySymtableEntryObjects.  If it is true, there is an optimization
    conflict.

    Modify get_ref_type to respect st_nested_scopes flags.

    Refactor symtable_load_symbols() into several smaller functions,
    which use struct symbol_info to share variables.  In new function
    symtable_update_flags(), raise an error or warning for import * or
    bare exec that conflicts with nested scopes.  Also, modify handle
    for free variables to respect st_nested_scopes flag.

    In symtable_init() assign st_nested_scopes flag to
    NESTED_SCOPES_DEFAULT (defined in compile.h).

    Add preliminary and often incorrect implementation of
    symtable_check_future().

    Add symtable_lookup() helper for future use.

There are good and bad reasons for this.  The good reason is to support
dir() "like before" on objects of extension types that haven't migrated
to the class introspection API yet.  The bad reason is that Python's own
method objects are such a type, and this is the quickest way to get their
im_self etc attrs to "show up" via dir().  It looks much messier to move
them to the new scheme, as their current getattr implementation presents
a view of their attrs that's a untion of their own attrs plus their
im_func's attrs.  In particular, methodobject.__dict__ actually returns
methodobject.im_func.__dict__, and if that's important to preserve it
doesn't seem to fit the class introspection model at all.

- Minor fiddling related to
  SF patch 416251 2.1c1 mmapmodule: unused vrbl cleanup

- Fix the .find() method for memory maps.

  1) it didn't obey the "start" parameter (and when it does, we must
     validate the value)
  2) the return value needs to be an absolute index, rather than
     relative to some arbitrary point in the file

  (checking CVS, it appears this method never worked; these changes
   bring it into line with typical .find() behavior)


- Fix new compiler warnings.  Also boost "start" from (C) int to long and
  return a (C) long:  PyArg_ParseTuple and Py_BuildValue may not let
  us get at the size_t we really want, but C int is clearly too small
  for a 64-bit box, and both the start parameter and the return value
  should work for large mapped files even on 32-bit boxes.  The code
  really needs to be rethought from scratch (not by me, though ...).

  Yukihiro Nakadaira noticed a typo in encode_7or8bit that was trying

  question is never used, because whereas it was designed to trigger
  if the payload encoding was eight bit but its output encoding was
  7 bit, in practice the payload is always converted to the 7bit
  encoding before encode_7or8bit is called.  Patch by Shawat Anand.

  Buffer objects would return the read or write buffer for a wrapped object when
  the char buffer was requested.  Now it actually returns the char buffer if
  available or raises a TypeError if it isn't (as is raised for the other buffer
  types if they are not present but requested).

  Not a backport candidate since it does change semantics of the buffer object
  (although it could be argued this is enough of a bug to bother backporting).

  older WH generator for lists with just a few dozen elements,
  and so could potentially bite the naive ;-), the Twister should
  show excellent behavior up to at least 600 elements.

  Module docstring:  reflowed some jarringly short lines.

  arguments for sanity.  That should all be changed (it's not a logical error
  in the software if a user passes bogus arguments, so this isn't a reasonable
  use for `assert` -- checking external preconditions should generally raise
  ValueError or TypeError instead, as appropriate).

  SequenceMatcher.get_matching_blocks():  This now guarantees that

  nothing about this was documented before.  Since it was working
  as designed, and behavior was consistent with the docs, it wasn't

  - Added version checks in C code to make sure we don't trigger bugs in older
    SQLite versions.
  - Added version checks in test suite so that we don't execute tests that we
    know will fail with older (buggy) SQLite versions.

  Now, all tests should run against all SQLite versions from 3.0.8 until 3.3.6
  (latest one now). The sqlite3 module can be built against all these SQLite
  versions and the sqlite3 module does its best to not trigger bugs in SQLite,
  but using SQLite 3.3.3 or later is recommended.

  This backs out the test changes in 46962 which prevented crashes
  by not running the tests via a version check.  All the version checks
  added in that rev were removed from the tests.

  Code was added to the error handler in connection.c that seems

  The hppa ubuntu box sometimes hangs forever in these tests.  My guess
  is that the wait is failing for some reason.  Use WNOHANG, so we won't
  wait until the buildbot kills the test suite.

  I haven't been able to reproduce the failure, so I'm not sure if
  this will help or not.  Hopefully, this change will cause the test
  to fail, rather than hang.  That will be better since we will get
  the rest of the test results.  It may also help us debug the real problem.

  TestHelp.make_parser():  This was making a permanent change to
  os.environ (setting envar COLUMNS), which at least caused
  test_float_default() to fail if the tests were run more than once.

  This repairs the test_optparse -R failures Neal reported on
  python-dev.  It also explains some seemingly bizarre test_optparse
  failures we saw a couple weeks ago on the buildbots, when
  test_optparse failed due to test_file failing to clean up after
  itself, and then test_optparse failed in an entirely different
  way when regrtest's -w option ran test_optparse a second time.
  It's now obvious that make_parser() permanently changing os.environ
  was responsible for the second half of that.

  Fix for an obscure bug introduced by revs 46806 and 46808, with a test.
  The problem of checking too eagerly for recursive calls is the
  following: if a RuntimeError is caused by recursion, and if code needs
  to normalize it immediately (as in the 2nd test), then
  PyErr_NormalizeException() needs a call to the RuntimeError class to
  instantiate it, and this hits the recursion limit again...  causing
  PyErr_NormalizeException() to never finish.

  Moved this particular recursion check to slot_tp_call(), which is not
  involved in instantiating built-in exceptions.

  Backport candidate.

  Fit Makefile for the Python doc environment better; this is a step toward
  including the howtos in the build process.

  	* Put LaTeX output in ../paper-<whatever>/.
  	* Put HTML output in ../html/
  	* Explain some of the Makefile variables
  	* Remove some cruft dating to my environment (e.g. the 'web' target)

  This makefile isn't currently invoked by the documentation build process,
  so these changes won't destabilize anything.

  On FreeBSD, the two methods lockf() and flock() end up using the same

  two methods are orthogonal (so locks acquired one way don't interact
  with locks acquired the other way) but that clearly must be false.

  Attempt to fix build failure on OS X and Debian alpha; the symptom is
  consistent with os.wait() returning immediately because some other
  subprocess had previously exited; the test suite then immediately
  tries to lock the mailbox and gets an error saying it's already
  locked.

  To fix this, do a waitpid() so the test suite only continues once
  the intended child process has exited.

  This patch solves the problem Skip was seeing with zlib, this patch ensures that
  configure uses similar compiler flags as setup.py when doing the zlib test.

  Without this patch configure would use the first shared library on the linker
  path, with this patch it uses the first shared or static library on that path
  just like setup.py.

  Restore rev 47014:

  The hppa ubuntu box sometimes hangs forever in these tests.  My guess
  is that the wait is failing for some reason.  Use WNOHANG, so we won't
  wait until the buildbot kills the test suite.

  I haven't been able to reproduce the failure, so I'm not sure if
  this will help or not.  Hopefully, this change will cause the test
  to fail, rather than hang.  That will be better since we will get
  the rest of the test results.  It may also help us debug the real problem.

  *** The reason this originally failed was because there were many
  zombie children outstanding before rev 47158 cleaned them up.
  There are still hangs in test_subprocess that need to be addressed,
  but that will take more work.  This should close some holes.

  decode_rfc2231(): Be more robust against buggy RFC 2231 encodings.
  Specifically, instead of raising a ValueError when there is a single tick in
  the parameter, simply return that the entire string unquoted, with None for
  both the charset and the language.  Also, if there are more than 2 ticks in
  the parameter, interpret the first three parts as the standard RFC 2231 parts,
  then the rest of the parts as the encoded string.

  Test cases added.

  Original fewer-than-3-parts fix by Tokio Kikuchi.

  Resolves SF bug # 1218081.  I will back port the fix and tests to Python 2.4
  (email 3.0) and Python 2.3 (email 2.5).

  Also, bump the version number to email 4.0.1, removing the 'alpha' moniker.

  SF bug 1524317: configure --without-threads fails to build

  Moved the code for _PyThread_CurrentFrames() up, so it's no longer
  in a huge "#ifdef WITH_THREAD" block (I didn't realize it /was/ in
  one).

  Changed test_sys's test_current_frames() so it passes with or without
  thread supported compiled in.

  Note that test_sys fails when Python is compiled without threads,
  but for an unrelated reason (the old test_exit() fails with an
  indirect ImportError on the `thread` module).  There are also
  other unrelated compilation failures without threads, in extension
  modules (like ctypes); at least the core compiles again.

  Do we really support --without-threads?  If so, there are several
  problems remaining.

  More RFC 2231 improvements for the email 4.0 package.  As Mark Sapiro rightly
  points out there are really two types of continued headers defined in this
  RFC (i.e. "encoded" parameters with the form "name*0*=" and unencoded
  parameters with the form "name*0="), but we were were handling them both the
  same way and that isn't correct.

  This patch should be much more RFC compliant in that only encoded params are
  %-decoded and the charset/language information is only extract if there are
  any encoded params in the segments.  If there are no encoded params then the
  RFC says that there will be no charset/language parts.

  Note however that this will change the return value for Message.get_param() in
  some cases.  For example, whereas before if you had all unencoded param
  continuations you would have still gotten a 3-tuple back from this method
  (with charset and language == None), you will now get just a string.  I don't
  believe this is a backward incompatible change though because the
  documentation for this method already indicates that either return value is
  possible and that you must do an isinstance(val, tuple) check to discriminate
  between the two.  (Yeah that API kind of sucks but we can't change /that/
  without breaking code.)

  Test cases, some documentation updates, and a NEWS item accompany this patch.

  Bug #1521947:  possible bug in mystrtol.c with recent gcc.

  In general, C doesn't define anything about what happens when
  an operation on a signed integral type overflows, and PyOS_strtol()
  did several formally undefined things of that nature on signed
  longs.  Some version of gcc apparently tries to exploit that now,
  and PyOS_strtol() could fail to detect overflow then.

  Tried to repair all that, although it seems at least as likely to me
  that we'll get screwed by bad platform definitions for LONG_MIN
  and/or LONG_MAX now.  For that reason, I don't recommend backporting
  this.

  Note that I have no box on which this makes a lick of difference --
  can't really test it, except to note that it didn't break anything
  on my boxes.

  Silent change:  PyOS_strtol() used to return the hard-coded 0x7fffffff
  in case of overflow.  Now it returns LONG_MAX.  They're the same only on
  32-bit boxes (although C doesn't guarantee that either ...).

  check_node():  stop spraying mystery output to stderr.

  When a node number disagrees, keep track of all sources & the
  node numbers they reported, and stick all that in the error message.

  Changed all callers to supply a non-empty "source" argument; made
  the "source" argument non-optional.

  On my box, test_uuid still fails, but with the less confusing output:

  AssertionError: different sources disagree on node:
      from source 'getnode1', node was 00038a000015
      from source 'getnode2', node was 00038a000015
      from source 'ipconfig', node was 001111b2b7bf

  Only the last one appears to be correct; e.g.,

  Patch #1520294: Support for getset and member descriptors in types.py,
  inspect.py, and pydoc.py.  Specifically, this allows for querying the type of
  an object against these built-in C types and more importantly, for getting
  their docstrings printed in the interactive interpreter's help() function.

  This patch includes a new built-in module called _types which provides
  definitions of getset and member descriptors for use by the types.py module.
  These types are exposed as types.GetSetDescriptorType and
  types.MemberDescriptorType.  Query functions are provided as
  inspect.isgetsetdescriptor() and inspect.ismemberdescriptor().  The
  implementations of these are robust enough to work with Python implementations
  other than CPython, which may not have these fundamental types.

  The patch also includes documentation and test suite updates.

  I commit these changes now under these guiding principles:

  1. Silence is assent.  The release manager has not said "no", and of the few
     people that cared enough to respond to the thread, the worst vote was "0".

  2. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.

  3. It's so dang easy to revert stuff in svn, that you could view this as a
     forcing function. :)

  Windows build patches will follow.

  Reorganize the docs for 'file' and 'open()' after some discussion with Fred.

  We want to encourage users to write open() when opening a file, but
  open() was described with a single paragraph and
  'file' had lots of explanation of the mode and bufsize arguments.

  I've shrunk the description of 'file' to cross-reference to the 'File
  objects' section, and to open() for an explanation of the arguments.

  open() now has all the paragraphs about the mode string.  The bufsize
  argument was moved up so that it isn't buried at the end; now there's
  1 paragraph on mode, 1 on bufsize, and then 3 more on mode.  Various
  other edits and rearrangements were made in the process.

  It's probably best to read the final text and not to try to make sense
  of the diffs.

  Try to squash struct.pack warnings on the "amd64 gentoo trunk"
  buildbot (& possibly other 64-bit boxes) during test_gzip.

  The native zlib crc32 function returns an unsigned 32-bit integer,
  which the Python wrapper implicitly casts to C long.  Therefore the
  same crc can "look negative" on a 32-bit box but "look positive" on
  a 64-bit box.  This patch papers over that platform difference when
  writing the crc to file.

  It may be better to change the Python wrapper, either to make
  the result "look positive" on all platforms (which means it may
  have to return a Python long at times on a 32-bit box), or to
  keep the sign the same across boxes.  But that would be a visible
  change in what users see, while the current hack changes no
  visible behavior (well, apart from stopping the struct deprecation
  warning).

  Note that the module-level write32() function is no longer used.

  test_copytree_simple():  This was leaving behind two new temp
  directories each time it ran, at least on Windows.

  Several changes:  explicitly closed all files; wrapped long
  lines; stopped suppressing errors when removing a file or
  directory fails (removing /shouldn't/ fail!); and changed
  what appeared to be incorrect usage of os.removedirs() (that
  doesn't remove empty directories at and /under/ the given
  path, instead it must be given an empty leaf directory and
  then deletes empty directories moving /up/ the path -- could
  be that the conceptually simpler shutil.rmtree() was really
  actually intended here).

  Buffer objects would return the read or write buffer for a wrapped object when
  the char buffer was requested.  Now it actually returns the char buffer if
  available or raises a TypeError if it isn't (as is raised for the other buffer
  types if they are not present but requested).

  Not a backport candidate since it does change semantics of the buffer object
  (although it could be argued this is enough of a bug to bother backporting).

  arguments for sanity.  That should all be changed (it's not a logical error
  in the software if a user passes bogus arguments, so this isn't a reasonable
  use for `assert` -- checking external preconditions should generally raise
  ValueError or TypeError instead, as appropriate).

  - Added version checks in C code to make sure we don't trigger bugs in older
    SQLite versions.
  - Added version checks in test suite so that we don't execute tests that we
    know will fail with older (buggy) SQLite versions.

  Now, all tests should run against all SQLite versions from 3.0.8 until 3.3.6
  (latest one now). The sqlite3 module can be built against all these SQLite
  versions and the sqlite3 module does its best to not trigger bugs in SQLite,
  but using SQLite 3.3.3 or later is recommended.

  The hppa ubuntu box sometimes hangs forever in these tests.  My guess
  is that the wait is failing for some reason.  Use WNOHANG, so we won't
  wait until the buildbot kills the test suite.

  I haven't been able to reproduce the failure, so I'm not sure if
  this will help or not.  Hopefully, this change will cause the test
  to fail, rather than hang.  That will be better since we will get
  the rest of the test results.  It may also help us debug the real problem.

  TestHelp.make_parser():  This was making a permanent change to
  os.environ (setting envar COLUMNS), which at least caused
  test_float_default() to fail if the tests were run more than once.

  This repairs the test_optparse -R failures Neal reported on
  python-dev.  It also explains some seemingly bizarre test_optparse
  failures we saw a couple weeks ago on the buildbots, when
  test_optparse failed due to test_file failing to clean up after
  itself, and then test_optparse failed in an entirely different
  way when regrtest's -w option ran test_optparse a second time.
  It's now obvious that make_parser() permanently changing os.environ
  was responsible for the second half of that.

  Fix for an obscure bug introduced by revs 46806 and 46808, with a test.
  The problem of checking too eagerly for recursive calls is the
  following: if a RuntimeError is caused by recursion, and if code needs
  to normalize it immediately (as in the 2nd test), then
  PyErr_NormalizeException() needs a call to the RuntimeError class to
  instantiate it, and this hits the recursion limit again...  causing
  PyErr_NormalizeException() to never finish.

  Moved this particular recursion check to slot_tp_call(), which is not
  involved in instantiating built-in exceptions.

  Backport candidate.

  Attempt to fix build failure on OS X and Debian alpha; the symptom is
  consistent with os.wait() returning immediately because some other
  subprocess had previously exited; the test suite then immediately
  tries to lock the mailbox and gets an error saying it's already
  locked.

  To fix this, do a waitpid() so the test suite only continues once
  the intended child process has exited.

  This patch solves the problem Skip was seeing with zlib, this patch ensures that
  configure uses similar compiler flags as setup.py when doing the zlib test.

  Without this patch configure would use the first shared library on the linker

  just like setup.py.

  Restore rev 47014:

  The hppa ubuntu box sometimes hangs forever in these tests.  My guess
  is that the wait is failing for some reason.  Use WNOHANG, so we won't
  wait until the buildbot kills the test suite.

  I haven't been able to reproduce the failure, so I'm not sure if
  this will help or not.  Hopefully, this change will cause the test
  to fail, rather than hang.  That will be better since we will get
  the rest of the test results.  It may also help us debug the real problem.

  *** The reason this originally failed was because there were many
  zombie children outstanding before rev 47158 cleaned them up.
  There are still hangs in test_subprocess that need to be addressed,
  but that will take more work.  This should close some holes.

  decode_rfc2231(): Be more robust against buggy RFC 2231 encodings.
  Specifically, instead of raising a ValueError when there is a single tick in
  the parameter, simply return that the entire string unquoted, with None for
  both the charset and the language.  Also, if there are more than 2 ticks in
  the parameter, interpret the first three parts as the standard RFC 2231 parts,
  then the rest of the parts as the encoded string.

  Test cases added.

  Original fewer-than-3-parts fix by Tokio Kikuchi.

  Resolves SF <b>bpo-1218081</b>.  I will back port the fix and tests to Python 2.4
  (email 3.0) and Python 2.3 (email 2.5).

  SF <b>bpo-1524317</b>: configure --without-threads fails to build

  Moved the code for _PyThread_CurrentFrames() up, so it's no longer
  in a huge "#ifdef WITH_THREAD" block (I didn't realize it /was/ in
  one).

  Changed test_sys's test_current_frames() so it passes with or without
  thread supported compiled in.

  Note that test_sys fails when Python is compiled without threads,
  but for an unrelated reason (the old test_exit() fails with an
  indirect ImportError on the `thread` module).  There are also
  other unrelated compilation failures without threads, in extension
  modules (like ctypes); at least the core compiles again.

  Do we really support --without-threads?  If so, there are several
  problems remaining.

  More RFC 2231 improvements for the email 4.0 package.  As Mark Sapiro rightly
  points out there are really two types of continued headers defined in this
  RFC (i.e. "encoded" parameters with the form "name*0*=" and unencoded
  parameters with the form "name*0="), but we were were handling them both the
  same way and that isn't correct.

  This patch should be much more RFC compliant in that only encoded params are
  %-decoded and the charset/language information is only extract if there are
  any encoded params in the segments.  If there are no encoded params then the
  RFC says that there will be no charset/language parts.

  Note however that this will change the return value for Message.get_param() in
  some cases.  For example, whereas before if you had all unencoded param
  continuations you would have still gotten a 3-tuple back from this method
  (with charset and language == None), you will now get just a string.  I don't
  believe this is a backward incompatible change though because the
  documentation for this method already indicates that either return value is
  possible and that you must do an isinstance(val, tuple) check to discriminate
  between the two.  (Yeah that API kind of sucks but we can't change /that/
  without breaking code.)

  Test cases, some documentation updates, and a NEWS item accompany this patch.

  without causing problems for anyone that is on a case-insensitive filesystem).

  Setup.py tries to compile the MacOS extension from MacOSmodule.c, while the
  actual file is named macosmodule.c. This is no problem on the (default)
  case-insensitive filesystem, but doesn't work on case-sensitive filesystems.

  <b>bpo-1521947</b>:  possible bug in mystrtol.c with recent gcc.

  In general, C doesn't define anything about what happens when
  an operation on a signed integral type overflows, and PyOS_strtol()
  did several formally undefined things of that nature on signed
  longs.  Some version of gcc apparently tries to exploit that now,
  and PyOS_strtol() could fail to detect overflow then.

  Tried to repair all that, although it seems at least as likely to me
  that we'll get screwed by bad platform definitions for LONG_MIN
  and/or LONG_MAX now.  For that reason, I don't recommend backporting
  this.

  Note that I have no box on which this makes a lick of difference --
  can't really test it, except to note that it didn't break anything
  on my boxes.

  Silent change:  PyOS_strtol() used to return the hard-coded 0x7fffffff
  in case of overflow.  Now it returns LONG_MAX.  They're the same only on
  32-bit boxes (although C doesn't guarantee that either ...).

  check_node():  stop spraying mystery output to stderr.

  When a node number disagrees, keep track of all sources & the
  node numbers they reported, and stick all that in the error message.

  Changed all callers to supply a non-empty "source" argument; made
  the "source" argument non-optional.

  On my box, test_uuid still fails, but with the less confusing output:

  AssertionError: different sources disagree on node:
      from source 'getnode1', node was 00038a000015
      from source 'getnode2', node was 00038a000015
      from source 'ipconfig', node was 001111b2b7bf

  Only the last one appears to be correct; e.g.,

  C:\Code\python\PCbuild>getmac

  Patch <b>bpo-1520294</b>: Support for getset and member descriptors in types.py,
  inspect.py, and pydoc.py.  Specifically, this allows for querying the type of
  an object against these built-in C types and more importantly, for getting
  their docstrings printed in the interactive interpreter's help() function.

  This patch includes a new built-in module called _types which provides
  definitions of getset and member descriptors for use by the types.py module.
  These types are exposed as types.GetSetDescriptorType and
  types.MemberDescriptorType.  Query functions are provided as
  inspect.isgetsetdescriptor() and inspect.ismemberdescriptor().  The
  implementations of these are robust enough to work with Python implementations
  other than CPython, which may not have these fundamental types.

  The patch also includes documentation and test suite updates.

  I commit these changes now under these guiding principles:

  1. Silence is assent.  The release manager has not said "no", and of the few
     people that cared enough to respond to the thread, the worst vote was "0".

  2. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.

  3. It's so dang easy to revert stuff in svn, that you could view this as a
     forcing function. :)

  Windows build patches will follow.

  Reorganize the docs for 'file' and 'open()' after some discussion with Fred.

  We want to encourage users to write open() when opening a file, but
  open() was described with a single paragraph and
  'file' had lots of explanation of the mode and bufsize arguments.

  I've shrunk the description of 'file' to cross-reference to the 'File
  objects' section, and to open() for an explanation of the arguments.

  open() now has all the paragraphs about the mode string.  The bufsize
  argument was moved up so that it isn't buried at the end; now there's
  1 paragraph on mode, 1 on bufsize, and then 3 more on mode.  Various
  other edits and rearrangements were made in the process.

  It's probably best to read the final text and not to try to make sense
  of the diffs.

  Try to squash struct.pack warnings on the "amd64 gentoo trunk"
  buildbot (& possibly other 64-bit boxes) during test_gzip.

  The native zlib crc32 function returns an unsigned 32-bit integer,
  which the Python wrapper implicitly casts to C long.  Therefore the
  same crc can "look negative" on a 32-bit box but "look positive" on
  a 64-bit box.  This patch papers over that platform difference when
  writing the crc to file.

  It may be better to change the Python wrapper, either to make
  the result "look positive" on all platforms (which means it may
  have to return a Python long at times on a 32-bit box), or to
  keep the sign the same across boxes.  But that would be a visible
  change in what users see, while the current hack changes no
  visible behavior (well, apart from stopping the struct deprecation
  warning).

  Note that the module-level write32() function is no longer used.

  test_copytree_simple():  This was leaving behind two new temp
  directories each time it ran, at least on Windows.

  Several changes:  explicitly closed all files; wrapped long
  lines; stopped suppressing errors when removing a file or
  directory fails (removing /shouldn't/ fail!); and changed
  what appeared to be incorrect usage of os.removedirs() (that
  doesn't remove empty directories at and /under/ the given
  path, instead it must be given an empty leaf directory and
  then deletes empty directories moving /up/ the path -- could
  be that the conceptually simpler shutil.rmtree() was really
  actually intended here).

<pre>[<b>04f2801d9977</b>]: SF patch #474175 (Jay T Miller): file.readinto arg parsing bug

    The C-code in fileobject.readinto(buffer) which parses
    the arguments assumes that size_t is interchangeable
    with int:

	    size_t ntodo, ndone, nnow;

	    if (f->f_fp == NULL)
		    return err_closed();
	    if (!PyArg_Parse(args, "w#", &ptr, &ntodo))
		    return NULL;

    This causes a problem on Alpha / Tru64 / OSF1 v5.1
    where size_t is a long and sizeof(long) != sizeof(int).

    The patch I'm proposing declares ntodo as an int.  An
    alternative might be to redefine w# to expect size_t.

[We can't change w# because there are probably third party modules
relying on it. GvR]

    Revert the changes from r74463, they were causing test_xmlrpc to fail.
    We do not need to force a close when using socket buffering on a
    httplib.HTTPRequest as the library does not support streaming requests
    so there should never been extra data beyond the end of the current
    request to have left over in the requests socket buffer.

    Revert the changes from r74463, they were causing test_xmlrpc to fail.
    We do not need to force a close when using socket buffering on a
    httplib.HTTPRequest as the library does not support streaming requests
    so there should never been extra data beyond the end of the current
    request to have left over in the requests socket buffer.

    Removed calls to PyFloat_AsReprString.
    This is in anticipation of possibly implementing <b>bpo-7117</b> (short float repr).
    This removes the last calls to PyFloat_AsString, PyFloat_AsReprString, and
    PyFloat_AsStringEx, which are unsafe.

    Also, switch to defines for error values to bring this code more in line
    with the py3k branch.

<pre>[<b>04f2801d9977</b>]: SF patch #474175 (Jay T Miller): file.readinto arg parsing bug

    The C-code in fileobject.readinto(buffer) which parses
    the arguments assumes that size_t is interchangeable
    with int:

	    size_t ntodo, ndone, nnow;

	    if (f->f_fp == NULL)
		    return err_closed();
	    if (!PyArg_Parse(args, "w#", &ptr, &ntodo))
		    return NULL;

    This causes a problem on Alpha / Tru64 / OSF1 v5.1
    where size_t is a long and sizeof(long) != sizeof(int).

    The patch I'm proposing declares ntodo as an int.  An
    alternative might be to redefine w# to expect size_t.

[We can't change w# because there are probably third party modules
relying on it. GvR]
